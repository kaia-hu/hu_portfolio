# Final Project: Buying Property? Here’s Why Climate Change Must Be Your Top Priority (Before It’s Too Late!)
## Summary
This project will tell a story of why climate change should be many American's top priority in buying a property. It will first challenge the readers' existing values and preferences on buying houses and then their notion that climate change won't impact them. In the end, it will present solutions for (worried) readers on how they can pick their next homes as well as those who are expecting potential climate change impact on their existing homes. 
## Introduction
The two hurricanes swept through Florida last month have shaken my view on climate change. While many scientists and international organizations have been reporting nonstop on how we are falling behind on the global agenda to keep global warming in check, witnessing the unprecedented devastating impact it now has on our lives is mindblowing. One new topic that was brought to the spotlight is the housing crisis in a world undergoing exacerbating climate change. I also found it ironic that the areas that are traditionally more attractive to house hunters, like beach properties, are on the top of the vulnerability list. Therefore, I want to use this project to tell people a story of how we should view climate change as an ongoing crisis and include it in part of our life planning. <br>
## Story Outline
### I want to start the story by painting a beautiful and hopeful image of buying an oceanside property, using images to make the audience feel like the character. I will also use some data to show that the majority of Americans have similar preferences.

### Then I want to bring the first conflict, by showing pictures of houses being destroyed during climate-change-related natural disasters.

### Some audiences may react to those events by mentioning that they are individual, isolating events. So I will bring up the next conflict, by showing that climate-change-induced natural disasters are not individual events and our homes will be impacted by it more and more.

### This timeline demonstrates the big events that have happened and hints to the audience that the frequency of those disasters is increasing.

### Those additional charts will further emphasize to the readers that climate change has become a very serious issue for this world and will become an increasingly important factor in choosing a secure home.

### Finally, a resolution page will be created where the audience is taken to the beginning of this article and asked again about what they will pick when choosing where to live. This section will also provide more resources for audiences to look up later.

## Method and medium
I suggest using ArcGIS Story Maps since this project will utilize a lot of maps. There are some functionalities such as timeline that ArcGIS Story Map lacks, so I will use more trial and error on both ArcGIS Story Maps and Shorthand to figure out the best delivery medium.
