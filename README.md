## About Me
I am a second-year Master's student in **Public Policy & Management, Data Analytics** pathway at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. I go by **she/her** pronouns. I love nature, outdoors, animals and coffee. 
## What I hope to learn
I have always been fascinated by the power of data storytelling, and so far have dabbled in the world of map making and GIS. However, the more I use it, the more I realize the sheer diversity and vigor of the world of data storytelling. From this class, I want to understand how to reach my audience through visualization more effectively and become very flexible in my toolkits.
